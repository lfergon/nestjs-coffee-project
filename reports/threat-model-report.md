## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### Tampering
1. **Asset**: GET // (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious modification of request data.
   **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

2. **Asset**: GET coffees/ (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious modification of request data.
   **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

3. **Asset**: GET coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious modification of request data.
   **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

4. **Asset**: POST coffees/ (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious modification of request data.
   **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

5. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious modification of request data.
   **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

6. **Asset**: DELETE coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious modification of request data.
   **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

7. **Asset**: Coffee (data)
   **Description**: Unauthorized modification of entity data.
   **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC using NestJS guards and ensure proper access control checks.

8. **Asset**: Flavor (data)
   **Description**: Unauthorized modification of entity data.
   **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC using NestJS guards and ensure proper access control checks.

9. **Asset**: Event (data)
   **Description**: Unauthorized modification of entity data.
   **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC using NestJS guards and ensure proper access control checks.

### Spoofing
1. **Asset**: Global Application Architecture (process)
   **Description**: Inadequate authentication mechanisms.
   **Mitigation**: Implement multi-factor authentication and proper session management.

## API Endpoint Security Highlights

### Endpoints with Critical or High Risks

#### GET //
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious modification of request data.
  - **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

#### GET coffees/
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious modification of request data.
  - **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

#### GET coffees/:id
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious modification of request data.
  - **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

#### POST coffees/
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious modification of request data.
  - **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

#### PATCH coffees/:id
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious modification of request data.
  - **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

#### DELETE coffees/:id
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious modification of request data.
  - **Mitigation**: Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.

## Data Entity Security Highlights

### Entities with Critical or High Risks

#### Coffee
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of entity data.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC using NestJS guards and ensure proper access control checks.

#### Flavor
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of entity data.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC using NestJS guards and ensure proper access control checks.

#### Event
(0 Critical, 1 High Risks)

- **[High] Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of entity data.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC using NestJS guards and ensure proper access control checks.

## Global & Architectural Recommendations

### Spoofing - [High]
**Threat**: Inadequate authentication mechanisms.
**Mitigation**: Implement multi-factor authentication and proper session management.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: Lack of rate limiting allows attackers to overwhelm resources.
**Mitigation**: Use @nestjs/throttler to implement rate limiting on all endpoints.

## Recommended Prioritization

Focus remediation efforts based on risk level:

### 2. High Risks (Address Next)
Address the 10 high-risk vulnerabilities following the critical ones. These often involve significant security gaps.

- Example: Tampering in GET // - Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.
- Example: Tampering in GET coffees/ - Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.
- Example: Tampering in GET coffees/:id - Use NestJS ValidationPipe with strict DTOs and whitelist validation.
- ... and 7 more.

### 3. Medium Risks (Address Systematically)
Plan to address the 16 medium-risk vulnerabilities as part of regular development cycles. These often relate to defense-in-depth.

## Conclusion

This AI-assisted STRIDE threat model provides a valuable baseline for understanding potential security risks in the application. It identified 26 threats, highlighting 0 critical and 10 high-risk issues requiring prompt attention. Implementing the recommended mitigations, prioritized by risk level, will significantly enhance the application's security posture. Remember that automated analysis is a starting point; manual review and deeper investigation by the development team are crucial for comprehensive security.
