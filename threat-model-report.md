## Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Attention Required)

### 1. Elevation of Privilege in PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
**Risk**: Critical
**Description**: An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., in input validation or authorization logic, if it existed) to gain unauthorized access to functionality or data that they are not permitted to access. Since this patch request has no authorization, it is inherently vulnerable.
  - Risk: Critical
  - Mitigation: As mentioned previously, implement a robust authentication and authorization mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC). Ensure that the authorization checks are correctly implemented to prevent unauthorized access to protected resources. Thoroughly test the authorization logic to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.

## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### Spoofing
1. **Asset**: GET coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: An attacker spoofs the identity of another user to access coffee details they are not authorized to view. Since there's no authentication, *anyone* can make the request.
   **Mitigation**: Implement authentication using NestJS's `@AuthGuard` and appropriate authentication strategies (e.g., JWT, OAuth). Define roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access coffee details.

2. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: An attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate user by guessing or brute-forcing the `id` parameter, allowing them to modify a coffee entry that doesn't belong to them. Since there's no authentication or authorization, any valid ID could be targeted.
  - Risk: High
  - Mitigation: Implement authentication and authorization.  Use a JWT-based authentication strategy with NestJS Passport.  Implement a Guard that verifies the user has permissions to modify the coffee entry associated with the given `id`. Even with authentication, ensure that the user authenticated is authorized to modify that specific resource.
   **Mitigation**: Implement authentication and authorization.  Use a JWT-based authentication strategy with NestJS Passport.  Implement a Guard that verifies the user has permissions to modify the coffee entry associated with the given `id`. Even with authentication, ensure that the user authenticated is authorized to modify that specific resource.

### Denial of Service
1. **Asset**: GET coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: An attacker floods the endpoint with a large number of requests, overwhelming the server and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
   **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting using a NestJS rate limiting module (e.g., `@nestjs/throttler`) or a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) in front of the NestJS application.  Set reasonable rate limits based on expected traffic patterns.

### Tampering
1. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious user modifies the request body to include invalid data, leading to application errors or data corruption if not properly validated. This is particularly concerning because the endpoint lacks input validation.
  - Risk: High
  - Mitigation: Implement robust input validation using NestJS's `ValidationPipe` in conjunction with `class-validator` decorators within a Data Transfer Object (DTO). Define a `UpdateCoffeeDto` with validation rules for each field (e.g., `IsString()`, `IsInt()`, `MinLength()`, `Max()`, etc.). Apply the `ValidationPipe` globally or to this specific endpoint.
   **Mitigation**: Implement robust input validation using NestJS's `ValidationPipe` in conjunction with `class-validator` decorators within a Data Transfer Object (DTO). Define a `UpdateCoffeeDto` with validation rules for each field (e.g., `IsString()`, `IsInt()`, `MinLength()`, `Max()`, etc.). Apply the `ValidationPipe` globally or to this specific endpoint.

## Data Entity Security Highlights

No critical or high-risk threats were identified specifically for the analyzed data entities.

## Global & Architectural Recommendations

### Spoofing - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of consistent authentication mechanisms across all controllers and endpoints allows unauthenticated users to access protected resources.  Since we only know about AppModule and CoffeesController, it is possible other controllers lack authentication entirely.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Spoofing - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Inconsistent use of authentication providers across different services or modules leading to users being able to spoof identities within certain parts of the application. For example, one service might use a local database for authentication while another relies on an external IdP with a potential mismatch in user identifiers.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Tampering - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of robust input validation allows attackers to modify data passed to the application, potentially affecting data integrity and system behavior. This vulnerability can be widespread if validation is not applied consistently to all incoming data.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Tampering - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Missing integrity checks on data persisted to the database. An attacker could directly modify the database records (if they gain access), bypassing the application's input validation and business logic.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Repudiation - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Insufficient audit logging makes it difficult to trace user actions and identify the source of security incidents, hindering accountability and incident response efforts. Specifically, important events like authentication attempts, data modifications, and administrative actions are not logged sufficiently.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Repudiation - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Lack of secure session management (if sessions are used) allows users to deny actions they performed using a compromised or manipulated session ID. If the application isn't stateless (e.g. using JWT), this is a valid concern.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Information Disclosure - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Exposing sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database passwords) in environment variables or configuration files accessible from the application code.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Information Disclosure - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Verbose error messages and stack traces reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings to attackers. For example, database connection strings, file paths, or library versions may be exposed.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of rate limiting allows attackers to overwhelm the application with excessive requests, leading to service unavailability. All six endpoints could be vulnerable if no rate-limiting middleware is in place.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Uncontrolled resource consumption (e.g., memory leaks, CPU exhaustion) caused by inefficient code or large data processing tasks. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Elevation of Privilege - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Inadequate role-based access control (RBAC) allows users to access or modify resources they are not authorized to.  If user roles are not correctly defined or enforced, users could potentially escalate their privileges.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Elevation of Privilege - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Vulnerable dependencies with known privilege escalation vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain elevated privileges within the application.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.
