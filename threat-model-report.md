## Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Attention Required)

### 1. Spoofing in PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
**Risk**: Critical
**Description**: A malicious user spoofs the identity of another user to modify a coffee entry they are not authorized to change. Since no authentication is in place, anyone can claim to be anyone else.
    *   Risk: Critical
    *   Mitigation: Implement an authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT, Passport.js) and associate each coffee entry with a user ID. Use a guard to ensure only the authenticated user who owns the coffee entry can modify it.

## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### Denial of Service
1. **Asset**: GET coffees/ (endpoint)
   **Description**: An attacker floods the endpoint with requests, overwhelming the server and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
   **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting middleware (e.g., using `@nestjs/throttler`) to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address within a given timeframe.  Configure appropriate server resources (CPU, memory) to handle expected traffic loads and potential spikes. Use caching mechanisms where appropriate.

2. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: A malicious user floods the endpoint with PATCH requests, overwhelming the server and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   Risk: High
    *   Mitigation: Implement rate limiting using NestJS's `ThrottlerModule`. Configure appropriate limits based on the expected usage patterns. Consider using a Redis or Memcached backend for the rate limiter to improve performance and scalability.

### Tampering
1. **Asset**: POST coffees/ (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious user modifies request payload to inject malicious data into the coffee creation process (e.g., extremely long strings for coffee names, SQL injection attempt if not using an ORM or if using raw queries improperly).
  - Risk: High
  - Mitigation: Implement robust input validation using NestJS `ValidationPipe` with `class-validator` decorators on the Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing the request body. Define max length, type, and allowed value constraints for all properties. Use an ORM (TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose) with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize input if direct database interaction is unavoidable.

Define max length, type, and allowed value constraints for all properties. Use an ORM (TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose) with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize input if direct database interaction is unavoidable.

2. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious user modifies request payload (e.g., coffee name, ingredients) to invalid or harmful values.
    *   Risk: High
    *   Mitigation: Implement robust input validation using NestJS `ValidationPipe` with `class-validator` decorators on a dedicated Data Transfer Object (DTO) for the PATCH request. Define clear validation rules (e.g., string length, allowed characters, numeric ranges). Employ strict type checking in TypeScript. Example: `@IsString() @Length(1, 100) name: string;`

Define clear validation rules (e.g., string length, allowed characters, numeric ranges). Employ strict type checking in TypeScript. Example: `@IsString() @Length(1, 100) name: string;`

3. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: User manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to modify a coffee entry they are not authorized to access.
    *   Risk: High
    *   Mitigation: After authentication and authorization (see Spoofing mitigation), implement an authorization check within the `PATCH` method. Retrieve the coffee entry using the `id` parameter and compare its associated user ID with the ID of the currently authenticated user. If they don't match, return a 403 Forbidden error.
   **Mitigation**: After authentication and authorization (see Spoofing mitigation), implement an authorization check within the `PATCH` method. Retrieve the coffee entry using the `id` parameter and compare its associated user ID with the ID of the currently authenticated user. If they don't match, return a 403 Forbidden error.

### Information Disclosure
1. **Asset**: POST coffees/ (endpoint)
   **Description**: Error messages reveal sensitive information about the application or database (e.g., database connection strings, internal paths, stack traces). This is particularly problematic since there's no authentication in place, making it available to anyone.
  - Risk: High
  - Mitigation:  Configure NestJS to use custom exception filters.  Catch all exceptions and return generic, user-friendly error messages to the client. Log detailed error information securely on the server-side for debugging, but *never* expose it to the client. Configure appropriate logging levels in production.

Log detailed error information securely on the server-side for debugging, but *never* expose it to the client. Configure appropriate logging levels in production.

### Elevation of Privilege
1. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: A malicious user exploits a vulnerability in the authorization mechanism (if implemented in the future but currently absent) to gain administrative privileges and modify all coffee entries. Since there's no authentication/authorization right now, implementing it incorrectly later could be a point of failure.
    *   Risk: High (if authentication/authorization added improperly later)
    *   Mitigation: If authentication and authorization are added, use a well-vetted and established authorization library (e.g., NestJS's built-in guards, Casbin). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with clearly defined roles and permissions. Regularly audit and review the authorization logic for vulnerabilities. Properly secure any API keys.

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with clearly defined roles and permissions. Regularly audit and review the authorization logic for vulnerabilities. Properly secure any API keys.

2. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: A vulnerability in the data validation logic allows a user to inject malicious code that is executed with elevated privileges on the server (e.g., SQL injection if using raw queries).
    *   Risk: High
    *   Mitigation: Use an ORM (e.g., TypeORM, Prisma) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid using raw SQL queries. Properly sanitize and validate all user input using `class-validator` and `ValidationPipe`. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Avoid direct execution of OS commands based on user input.

## Data Entity Security Highlights

No critical or high-risk threats were identified specifically for the analyzed data entities.

## Global & Architectural Recommendations

### Spoofing - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of adequate authentication allows unauthorized users to impersonate legitimate users or services, gaining access to resources or performing actions on their behalf.  Globally, a failure in a single authentication module can compromise the entire system.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Spoofing - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Missing or improperly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy allows malicious websites to spoof the origin of the NestJS application and make unauthorized API requests on behalf of users.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Tampering - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Insufficient input validation across the application allows attackers to inject malicious data, leading to data corruption, code execution, or other unintended consequences.  This could be in any of the 6 endpoints handling `Coffee`, `Flavor`, or `Event` data.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Tampering - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Lack of integrity checks on external dependencies could lead to supply chain attacks where compromised packages are used, potentially injecting malicious code into the application.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Repudiation - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Insufficient logging of critical security events (authentication failures, authorization violations, data modifications) prevents effective auditing and incident response, making it difficult to trace malicious activity back to its source.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Repudiation - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of a clear audit trail for data modifications. If `Coffee`, `Flavor`, or `Event` data is modified without proper logging, it is difficult to determine who made the changes, when, and why.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Information Disclosure - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Exposing sensitive information in error messages or stack traces can reveal internal system details to attackers, facilitating further attacks. For instance, stack traces could expose library versions or file paths.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Information Disclosure - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Insecure storage of sensitive configuration data (API keys, database credentials) can lead to unauthorized access to critical resources.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Lack of rate limiting allows attackers to flood the application with requests, overwhelming resources and causing service disruptions. A flood of requests against any of the 6 endpoints could cause problems.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Uncontrolled resource consumption (e.g., memory leaks, excessive file uploads) can exhaust server resources and lead to denial of service.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Elevation of Privilege - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Improper authorization checks allow unauthorized users to access resources or perform actions that are reserved for privileged users.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Elevation of Privilege - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Vulnerable dependencies with known elevation of privilege exploits could be leveraged to escalate privileges within the application.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.
