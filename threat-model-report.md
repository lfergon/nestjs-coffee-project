# NestJS Coffee API - STRIDE Threat Model Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive security analysis of the NestJS Coffee API application using the STRIDE threat modeling methodology. The analysis identified **77 potential security threats** across endpoints, data entities, and application architecture.

### Risk Level Distribution
- **Critical**: 3 threats (3.9%)
- **High**: 23 threats (29.9%)
- **Medium**: 38 threats (49.4%)
- **Low**: 13 threats (16.9%)

### Top Vulnerability Categories
1. **Authorization** - Lack of resource ownership validation and role-based access control
2. **Authentication** - Basic API key implementation without proper token management
3. **Input Validation** - Insufficient validation of string inputs and protection against injection attacks

### Most Vulnerable Components
- **Endpoints**: DELETE /coffees/:id, POST /coffees
- **Entities**: Event (used for audit trail but lacks proper security controls)
- **Infrastructure**: Lack of HTTPS and proper security headers

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Lack of HTTPS Configuration
**Risk**: Critical
**Description**: The application doesn't enforce HTTPS, allowing all API communications (including authentication credentials) to be transmitted in plaintext.
**Mitigation**: Configure HTTPS with proper certificates and enforce strict transport security.

### 2. API Keys Transmitted Without TLS
**Risk**: Critical
**Description**: API keys in Authorization headers are transmitted without encryption, making them susceptible to interception.
**Mitigation**: Enforce HTTPS for all API communications and consider moving to a more secure authentication mechanism.

### 3. No Audit Trail for Entity Deletion
**Risk**: Critical
**Description**: When entities are deleted, there's no record of who performed the deletion or when it occurred, making investigations impossible.
**Mitigation**: Implement soft deletes with metadata including who deleted the entity and when, with comprehensive audit logging.

## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **Simple API Key Authentication** (High)
   **Description**: The application uses a simple API key mechanism without token expiration.
   **Mitigation**: Implement JWT or OAuth2 with proper token expiration and refresh.

2. **No Resource Ownership Verification** (High)
   **Description**: Any authenticated user can modify any resource without ownership checks.
   **Mitigation**: Add ownership verification for all modification operations.

3. **No Role-Based Access Control** (High)
   **Description**: The application lacks role-based access control for restricting operations.
   **Mitigation**: Implement RBAC with proper role definitions and permission checks.

### Data Protection & Validation
1. **Database Credentials in Plaintext** (High)
   **Description**: Database credentials are stored in plaintext in docker-compose.yml.
   **Mitigation**: Use environment variables or secrets management for all credentials.

2. **No Sanitization Against XSS** (High)
   **Description**: String inputs aren't sanitized against XSS attacks.
   **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive XSS sanitization for all input strings.

3. **TypeORM Synchronize in Production** (High)
   **Description**: The TypeORM configuration has synchronize:true, which is dangerous in production.
   **Mitigation**: Disable synchronize in production environments and use migrations instead.

### Logging & Rate Limiting
1. **No Security Event Logging** (High)
   **Description**: The application lacks security-specific event logging.
   **Mitigation**: Add comprehensive security logging for authentication and data modification events.

2. **No Rate Limiting** (High)
   **Description**: There's no protection against brute force attacks or API abuse.
   **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting middleware for all endpoints.

## Detailed Endpoint Analysis

### GET /coffees (Public)
- **High Risk**: No pagination limits could allow resource exhaustion via large offset/limit values.
- **Medium Risk**: All coffee data exposed to unauthenticated users.
- **Mitigation**: Add hard upper limits to pagination (e.g., max 100 items) and consider requiring authentication.

### POST /coffees (API Key)
- **High Risk**: No limit on the number of coffee entities a user can create.
- **High Risk**: Large arrays of flavor strings could exhaust database resources.
- **High Risk**: No tracking of which user created which coffee record.
- **Mitigation**: Add creator tracking, implement rate limiting, and add maximum length validation to arrays.

### PATCH /coffees/:id (API Key)
- **High Risk**: No verification that user has rights to modify specific coffee entity.
- **High Risk**: No tracking of which user modified which coffee record.
- **Mitigation**: Implement ownership checks or role-based access for modification and add audit trails.

### DELETE /coffees/:id (API Key)
- **Critical Risk**: After deletion, no record of who deleted the entity.
- **High Risk**: No verification that user has rights to delete specific coffee entity.
- **High Risk**: Any user with API key can delete any coffee record.
- **Mitigation**: Implement soft deletes with metadata and enforce proper authorization.

## Entity Security Analysis

### Coffee Entity
- **Medium Risk**: No ownership tracking to verify who created or can modify entity.
- **Medium Risk**: No validation on title and brand string length.
- **Medium Risk**: No creation/modification timestamps or user tracking.
- **Mitigation**: Add ownership fields, timestamps, and string length validation.

### Event Entity
- **High Risk**: JSON payload column could contain any data without validation.
- **High Risk**: Events lack timestamp and user context necessary for audit.
- **High Risk**: Raw payload might contain sensitive data without proper sanitization.
- **Mitigation**: Add schema validation, timestamps, and implement proper sanitization.

## Global Security Recommendations

### 1. Authentication Improvements
- Replace API key authentication with JWT or OAuth2
- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Add brute force protection with account lockout
- Enforce HTTPS for all API communications

### 2. Authorization Controls
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add resource ownership verification
- Audit all @Public decorator usage and restrict to minimum
- Add attribute-based access control where appropriate

### 3. Data Protection
- Use environment variables or secrets management for credentials
- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Disable TypeORM synchronize in production
- Add database-level constraints

### 4. Input Validation
- Add string length validation to all string fields
- Implement XSS sanitization for all inputs
- Use parameterized queries consistently
- Add schema validation for JSON data

### 5. Infrastructure Security
- Configure HTTPS with proper certificates
- Implement rate limiting
- Define strict CORS policy
- Add Helmet middleware for security headers

### 6. Logging & Monitoring
- Implement structured logging with proper levels
- Add security-specific event logging
- Create comprehensive audit trails for data modifications
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities

## Recommended Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate** (within 1 week)
   - Configure HTTPS
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement pagination limits
   - Add Helmet for security headers

2. **Short-term** (1-4 weeks)
   - Improve authentication (JWT/OAuth2)
   - Add ownership checks and RBAC
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Add basic audit logging

3. **Medium-term** (1-3 months)
   - Create comprehensive audit system
   - Implement field-level encryption
   - Add advanced input validation
   - Improve error handling

4. **Long-term** (3+ months)
   - Implement advanced monitoring
   - Add automated security scanning
   - Create security regression tests
   - Conduct regular security assessments

## Conclusion

The NestJS Coffee API application has several security vulnerabilities that should be addressed before deployment to production. The most critical issues relate to lack of HTTPS, weak authentication mechanisms, and insufficient audit logging. By implementing the recommended mitigations, particularly those marked as Critical and High risk, the application's security posture will be significantly improved.
