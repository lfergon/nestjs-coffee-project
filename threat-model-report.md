## Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Attention Required)

### 1. Elevation of Privilege in PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
**Risk**: Critical
**Description**: Without authorization checks, any user can modify any coffee resource. This effectively elevates a regular user's privileges to that of an administrator or resource owner.
**Mitigation**: Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) system. Use NestJS guards to enforce authorization policies, ensuring that only authorized users can modify specific coffee entities.

## High-Risk Vulnerabilities

### Spoofing
1. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: An attacker spoofs the identity of another user and attempts to modify the coffee information using their ID.  Since no authentication is implemented, anyone can claim to be anyone.
   **Mitigation**: Implement authentication using NestJS Passport, JWT, or another secure authentication mechanism. Ensure proper validation and authorization checks before updating the coffee details.

### Tampering
1. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: Malicious user modifies request payload (e.g., `name`, `brand`, `flavors`) to insert harmful data, potentially leading to data corruption or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   **Mitigation**: Implement robust input validation using NestJS `ValidationPipe` with `class-validator` decorators on Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). Define strict data types, length constraints, and allowed values. Sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters.

2. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: An attacker tampers with the ID in the URL, trying to modify a coffee entity belonging to another user, if no authorization checks exist.
   **Mitigation**: Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only modify the coffee entities they own or are authorized to modify.  Use appropriate guards to enforce these authorization rules within the NestJS controller.

### Elevation of Privilege
1. **Asset**: PATCH coffees/:id (endpoint)
   **Description**: A malicious user bypasses validation and injects arbitrary code into database queries, leading to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation with elevated privileges.
   **Mitigation**: Use an ORM (TypeORM, Prisma) with built-in security features like parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  Avoid constructing raw SQL queries from user input.  Enforce strict input validation and sanitization.

## API Endpoint Security Highlights

### Endpoints with Critical or High Risks

#### PATCH coffees/:id
(1 Critical, 4 High Risks)

- **[High] Spoofing**: An attacker spoofs the identity of another user and attempts to modify the coffee information using their ID.  Since no authentication is implemented, anyone can claim to be anyone.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement authentication using NestJS Passport, JWT, or another secure authentication mechanism. Ensure proper validation and authorization checks before updating the coffee details.
- **[High] Tampering**: Malicious user modifies request payload (e.g., `name`, `brand`, `flavors`) to insert harmful data, potentially leading to data corruption or exploitation of vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust input validation using NestJS `ValidationPipe` with `class-validator` decorators on Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). Define strict data types, length constraints, and allowed values. Sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters.

## Data Entity Security Highlights

No critical or high-risk threats were identified specifically for the analyzed data entities.

## Global & Architectural Recommendations

### Spoofing - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of consistent authentication mechanisms across all controllers and routes, allowing an attacker to impersonate legitimate users or services. Imagine an attacker gains access to the system and utilizes functionality which is not behind any authentication method.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Spoofing - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Weak or predictable JWT signing keys or algorithms, making it possible to forge JWT tokens for unauthorized access.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Tampering - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of consistent input validation across all controllers and data entities, allowing attackers to manipulate data passed to the application.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Tampering - [Medium]
**Threat**: **  Lack of integrity checks on configuration files or environment variables, leading to unauthorized modifications of critical application settings (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Repudiation - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Insufficient logging of security-relevant events (authentication failures, authorization failures, data modifications, etc.), making it difficult to trace actions back to specific users.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Repudiation - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of audit trails for data modifications within the Coffee, Flavor, and Event entities, hindering the ability to identify the origin of changes.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Information Disclosure - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Unhandled exceptions and stack traces exposed to the client, revealing sensitive information about the application's internal workings and potential vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Information Disclosure - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Insecure storage of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) in plain text within configuration files, environment variables, or the database.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Lack of rate limiting on critical API endpoints (e.g., authentication, data creation), allowing attackers to overwhelm the application with requests.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Denial of Service - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Uncontrolled resource consumption (e.g., memory leaks, CPU exhaustion) due to inefficient code or lack of resource limits.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Elevation of Privilege - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Inadequate authorization checks, allowing users to access or modify data that they are not authorized to access.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

### Elevation of Privilege - [Medium]
**Threat**: ** Dependency vulnerabilities in installed npm packages, potentially allowing attackers to exploit known security flaws to gain elevated privileges.
**Mitigation**: Mitigation strategy not specified.

## Recommended Prioritization

Focus remediation efforts based on risk level:

### 1. Critical Risks (Address Immediately)
Prioritize fixing all 1 critical vulnerabilities identified. These represent the highest potential impact.

- Example: Elevation of Privilege in PATCH coffees/:id - Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) system. Use NestJS guards to enforce authorization policies, ensuring that only authorized users can modify specific coffee entities.

### 2. High Risks (Address Next)
Address the 4 high-risk vulnerabilities following the critical ones. These often involve significant security gaps.

- Example: Spoofing in PATCH coffees/:id - Implement authentication using NestJS Passport, JWT, or another secure authentication mechanism. Ensure proper validation and authorization checks before updating the coffee details.
- Example: Tampering in PATCH coffees/:id - Implement robust input validation using NestJS `ValidationPipe` with `class-validator` decorators on Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). Define strict data types, length constraints, and allowed values. Sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters.
- Example: Tampering in PATCH coffees/:id - Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only modify the coffee entities they own or are authorized to modify.  Use appropriate guards to enforce these authorization rules within the NestJS controller.
- ... and 1 more.

### 3. Medium Risks (Address Systematically)
Plan to address the 105 medium-risk vulnerabilities as part of regular development cycles. These often relate to defense-in-depth.

### 4. Low Risks (Address Opportunistically)
Address the 10 low-risk vulnerabilities when time permits or during related feature work. These are typically minor improvements or hardening measures.
